_Remove this line and the following paragraph once you read it:_

_Before writing anything, **define your scope**. Keep yourself on topic. The topic is your
project. You are not supposed to train someone on how to use a computer (I'm exaggerating a bit
to make this point very clear).Talk about your project. If you think you should explain something
else, external to the project, add a link. Be concise. Be expressive. Be [pragmatic](https://tldr.sh/)._
